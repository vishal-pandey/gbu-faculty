						Our program focuses on two major areas of research, namely, improvement of tolerance to abiotic stresses (i.e. drought and salt) in higher plants by improving root traits, and genome sequencing and analyses.
					</p>
					<h2>Abiotic Stress Tolerance</h2>
					<p>
						Water and nutrient availability limits plant growth and ultimately the yield in all agricultural ecosystems. While the breeders in the past decades have made huge improvements by manipulating ‘shoot-based traits’, especially the reproductive qualities, the root, an important ecological topic has received less attention. There is still an immense potential to increase yields because the wide genetic variation trapped in roots has not been exploited properly so far. About one-third of earth’s aerable land is arid, and there are very few areas that are not subject to periodic drought. Our group focuses on mechanism of root growth under abiotic stress and thereby improving stress tolerance in plant. We have identified genes encoding transcription factors and kinases and demonstrated their role in root development during abiotic stresses. Our long-term goal is to use genetic engineering to improve root biomass and tolerance to abiotic stresses of important crops particularly, chickpea.
					</p>
					<h2>Genome Sequencing</h2>
					<p>
						Our laboratory is one of the three Indian centers that sequenced chromosome 5 of tomato genome. Chickpea is the third most important food legume crop. We have published an advanced draft genome assembly and analysis of a desi-type chickpea. We have also reported a draft genome assembly of the wild progenitor of chickpea, Cicer reticulatum. These genome assemblies are being utilized in our laboratory to map the quantitative trait loci responsible in chickpea for root development under water deficit using mapping populations in order to improve chickpea yield with less water.
